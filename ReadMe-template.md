## My process
i used html  and its basic tags and elements to complete my work. i also used css to adjust position of the image comparing to the background. the whole idea of the assignment was to make the similar qr code as it was shown in the folder, so i tried to look at the image and read it in detail.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- 

### What I learned

i learned the basics of html tags, how to use them, how to adjust weight, heighth, width, of the elements. how we can add attribute and also the basic concept how html work should look. adding background, coloring it, changing texts, fonts, sizes, etc. 

```html
  <head>
    <title> The QR code </title>
  </head>
    <body style="background-color:#D5E1EF">
<div style="width:320px; height:497px; background-color:white; margin:auto; padding:16px; border-radius:20px">
  <img style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;font-family:Outfit;"src="https://i.ibb.co/XC7XkKQ/image-qr-code.png;"/>
    <h1 style="font-family:Outfit;font-size:22px;text-align:center;font-weight:700; color:hsl(218, 44%, 22%)"> Improve your front-end skills by building projects </h1>
    <p style="font-family:Outfit;font-size:15px;text-align:center;font-weight:400; color:#7D889E" > Scan the QR code to visit frontend mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>

    </body>
  
    </html>
```
```css
body{
width: 320px;
height: 497px;
left: 560px;
top: 152px;
position:absolute

}

```
### Continued development

even though it was my first assignment, im looking forward to learn fullstack, code languages such as css, java and others that will help me to understand the field.
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/R80j9FSk6f0) - the video lecture really helped me to get familiar with basics of HTML without having prequisite in the languages.
